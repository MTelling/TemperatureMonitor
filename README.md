# TemperatureMonitor

I have a Raspberry Pi running a python script, which sends the temperature of my room to a database every half minute. 
This server connects to that database, and shows the current temperature. This is then updated continuously via a web socket. 

Made using Node.js, Socket.io and MySQL.

The Bootstrap theme used is "Lumino Admin" from MediaLoot.com.
